# 📚 Learning Log  

Welcome to my **Learning Log**!  

This is a public record of my **journey into AI Engineering**, where I document what I’m learning, practicing, and building along the way.  
The goal is to show **consistent progress**, track skills, and create a portfolio of projects and reflections.  

⚡ **Career Note**: While I’m on this AI roadmap, I’m **still actively pursuing Full-Stack / Web Developer roles** (PERN stack).  
My software engineering career continues — this roadmap expands my skills into AI to position me for hybrid **AI + Web Dev** opportunities.

## 📆 Journey Overview (12-Month Roadmap)  

### **Section 1 – Python & LLM Basics**  
- Python fundamentals → variables, strings, loops, functions, collections.  
- File handling & simple CLI apps.  
- Intro to Large Language Models (LLMs).  
- First API call to an LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face).  
✅ **Exit:** One CLI app + one LLM “Hello World” script on GitHub.  

---

### **Section 2 – Data & Machine Learning Foundations**  
- NumPy (arrays, broadcasting).  
- Pandas (cleaning, transformations).  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualizations).  
- Supervised learning (regression, classification).  
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, PCA).  
- scikit-learn (pipelines, metrics, model evaluation).  
✅ **Exit:** 1–2 ML mini-projects (e.g., predictor/classifier).  

---

### **Section 3 – AI Apps & Deployment**  
- FastAPI basics (endpoints, request/response).  
- Flask (lightweight APIs).  
- Docker for containerization.  
- Cloud deployment (Hugging Face Spaces, Railway, Render, AWS/GCP).  
- Build small AI-powered apps (chatbot, summarizer).  
✅ **Exit:** 1 deployed AI app (with README + live demo link).  

---

### **Section 4 – Agents (Core Foundations + OpenAI Focus)**  
- LangChain fundamentals: chains, memory, tools, agents.  
- LlamaIndex basics: document loaders, indexing, queries.  
- Simple RAG pipelines (retrieve → generate).  
- OpenAI ecosystem (Assistants API, function calling, structured outputs).  
- Connecting to APIs & tools (Google Search, Python functions).  
- Single-agent apps (doc assistant, research bot).  
✅ **Exit:** A working AI assistant that integrates OpenAI + LangChain/LlamaIndex.  

---

### **Section 5 – Agents (Advanced Orchestration)**  
- Multi-agent systems (AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph).  
- Advanced RAG with vector DBs (Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS).  
- Orchestration strategies (task delegation, error handling, human-in-the-loop).  
- Building autonomous workflows.  
✅ **Exit:** Multi-agent system project (e.g., research team simulation).  

---

### **Section 6 – Scaling AI Engineering**  
- Experiment tracking (Weights & Biases, MLflow).  
- Improving model performance (hyperparameter tuning, embeddings).  
- Fine-tuning LLMs (LoRA, PEFT).  
- MLOps basics: CI/CD pipelines for ML.  
- Data pipelines (batch vs streaming).  
✅ **Exit:** 1 production-style ML pipeline with tracking + docs.  

---

### **Section 7 – Advanced Web + AI Integration**  
*(Bridging my Web Dev background with AI Engineering)*  
- React + AI (frontends consuming AI APIs).  
- Building AI features into full-stack apps (chat widgets, recommenders).  
- Secure API handling & rate limiting.  
- Deploying AI-backed web apps (Heroku, Vercel, AWS).  
✅ **Exit:** Full-stack PERN + AI project (portfolio-ready).  

---

### **Section 8 – Portfolio Development**  
- Select top 3–4 projects → polish & document.  
- Write READMEs, blog posts, or short demo videos.  
- Ensure repos are clean, commits consistent, code professional.  
- Start capstone design.  
✅ **Exit:** At least 2 polished projects recruiter-ready.  

---

### **Section 9 – Capstone & Career Prep**  
- Build final **capstone project** (end-to-end agentic AI system).  
- Resume update: emphasize **dual career track** (Full-Stack + AI Engineering).  
- GitHub cleanup (consistent style, README templates).  
- Mock interview prep (tech + behavioral).  
- Final portfolio showcase (LinkedIn, GitHub, portfolio site).  
✅ **Exit:** 1 capstone + 3–4 polished projects → recruiter-ready.
