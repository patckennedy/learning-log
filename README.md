# 📚 Learning Log  

Welcome to my **Learning Log**!  

This is a public record of my career enhancement journey learning Python & AI, where I document what I’m learning, practicing, and building along the way.  
The goal is to show consistent progress, strengthen both my software engineering and AI engineering skills, and create a portfolio of projects and reflections.  

⚡ **Career Note**: While I’m on this Python & AI roadmap, I’m still actively pursuing Full-Stack / Web Developer roles (PERN stack).  
My software engineering career continues — this roadmap expands my skills into Python & AI to position me for hybrid Python + AI + Web Dev opportunities.

## 📆 AI Learning Roadmap 

### **Section 1: – 🤖 chatbot-learning**  
- This section is dedicated to my **chatbot development journey**. I’m following the Udemy course *“Chatbot — The Development Guide 2025”* by Eric Roby, coding along step by step. For each tutorial project, I’ll also create a **spin-off version of my own**, applying the same skills in new contexts. This approach ensures I practice **80% coding / 20% reading** while building original chatbot apps for my portfolio and freelance opportunities.  

🔗 Repo: [chatbot-learning](https://github.com/patckennedy/chatbot-learning)

### **UPCOMING SECTIONS** 
- Section 2 – Data & Machine Learning Foundations
- Section 3 – AI Apps & Deployment 
- Section 4 – Agents (Core Foundations + OpenAI Focus)
- Section 5 – Agents (Advanced Orchestration)
- Section 6 – Scaling AI Engineering  
- Section 7 – Advanced Web + AI Integration 
- Section 8 – Portfolio Development  
- Section 9 – Capstone & Career Prep 

---

## 📂 Mini-Projects by Month  

- **[Month 1 – Python Fundamentals](month-01_python-llm-basics/README.md)** 

*(Each folder will contain mini-projects, notes, and a sub-README.)*  

---

## ✅ Current Status  

- **Starting Point**: IT Support → Full-Stack Developer (PERN) → AI Engineer in Training  
- **Currently Learning**: Month 1 – Python Foundations & Intro to LLMs  
- **Career Path Note**: Actively pursuing **Web Dev roles** while building AI Engineering skills in parallel.  

📖 **Study Tracks**:  
I am currently following three Udemy courses as part of my foundations:  

1. Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python – strengthening my Python fundamentals with exercises and mini-projects.
2. Chatbot — The Development Guide 2025 – learn Chatbots and build projects. 
3. LLM Engineering: Master AI, Large Language Models & Agents – learning practical LLM engineering concepts (transformers, context windows, APIs, agents).  

For both tracks, I:  
- Take my own notes and reflections in the Weekly Logs.  
- Rebuild or extend projects in a fresh environment to confirm understanding.  
- Create additional mini-projects inspired by what I’ve learned.  

This repo is my personal record of growth — not just following courses, but **turning lessons into my own work and portfolio pieces**.
