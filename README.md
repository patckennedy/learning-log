# 📚 Learning Log  

Welcome to my **Learning Log**!  

This is a public record of my **career enhancement journey learning Python & AI**, where I document what I’m learning, practicing, and building along the way.  
The goal is to show **consistent progress**, strengthen both my **software engineering** and **AI engineering** skills, and create a portfolio of projects and reflections.  

⚡ **Career Note**: While I’m on this AI roadmap, I’m **still actively pursuing Full-Stack / Web Developer roles** (PERN stack).  
My software engineering career continues — this roadmap expands my skills into AI to position me for hybrid **AI + Web Dev** opportunities.

## 📆 Journey Overview (12-Month Roadmap)  

### **Section 1: – Core Python Fundamentals**  
- Variables, data types, lists, dictionaries, tuples
- Operators: conditional operators, arithmetic operators, type conversions
- Conditional statements: if statements, elif statements, like statements
- Loops: for loops, while loops
- Advance features: Slices and exceptions
- Mutability
- Functions
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Methods)
- File handling & simple CLI apps.  
✅ **Exit:** One CLI app 

---
### **Section 2: – Python - Small Projects + OOP in Practice**  
- Learn how to split code into multiple files → Packages & Modules
- Focus on writing resuable classes and functions
- Learn how to handle errors with try/except and clauses
- Learn how to save and load data from files (basic data persistence)
- Best practices of programming (project planning, code setup)
- Rule: 80% Coding & 20% reading  
✅ **Exit:** Two projects - on GitHub 

---

### **Section 3: – Python - Other Important Skills**  
- Developer tools: → Git + GitHub for version control; Debugging tools, PIP, requirements.txt, modules and more
- Terminal: → Changing directories, printing out the working directory, modifying different files, deleting files and more
- Pick a track & build real projects:(for example: Web development, Automation, APIs, AI/LLMs)
- Rule: 80% Coding & 20% reading  
✅ **Exit:** One real project - on GitHub 

---

### **Section 4: – Python - Advance Skills**  
- Learn Pythons unique features (eg: comprehensions, generator expression, decorators, args, kwargs, type hints ...)
- Threading vs Multiprocessing
- AsyncIO
- GIL - Global Interpreter Lock
- Python versions
- Compliers: CPython vs PyPy vs MicroPython
- Rule: 80% Coding & 20% reading  
✅ **Exit:** One project. - on GitHub 

---

### **Section 5: – 🤖 chatbot-learning**  
- This section is dedicated to my **chatbot development journey**. I’m following the Udemy course *“Chatbot — The Development Guide 2025”* by Eric Roby, coding along step by step. For each tutorial project, I’ll also create a **spin-off version of my own**, applying the same skills in new contexts. This approach ensures I practice **80% coding / 20% reading** while building original chatbot apps for my portfolio and freelance opportunities.

### **UPCOMING SECTIONS** 
- Section 6 – Data & Machine Learning Foundations
- Section 7 – AI Apps & Deployment 
- Section 8 – Agents (Core Foundations + OpenAI Focus)
- Section 9 – Agents (Advanced Orchestration)
- Section 10 – Scaling AI Engineering  
- Section 11 – Advanced Web + AI Integration 
- Section 12 – Portfolio Development  
- Section 13 – Capstone & Career Prep 

---

## 📂 Mini-Projects by Month  

- **[Month 1 – Python Fundamentals](month-01_python-llm-basics/README.md)** 

*(Each folder will contain mini-projects, notes, and a sub-README.)*  

---

## ✅ Current Status  

- **Starting Point**: IT Support → Full-Stack Developer (PERN) → AI Engineer in Training  
- **Currently Learning**: Month 1 – Python Foundations & Intro to LLMs  
- **Career Path Note**: Actively pursuing **Web Dev roles** while building AI Engineering skills in parallel.  

📖 **Study Tracks**:  
I am currently following three Udemy courses as part of my foundations:  

1. **Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python** – strengthening my Python fundamentals with exercises and mini-projects.
2. **Chatbot — The Development Guide 2025** – learn Chatbots and build projects. 
3. **LLM Engineering: Master AI, Large Language Models & Agents** – learning practical LLM engineering concepts (transformers, context windows, APIs, agents).  

For both tracks, I:  
- Take **my own notes and reflections** in the Weekly Logs.  
- Rebuild or extend projects in a fresh environment to confirm understanding.  
- Create **additional mini-projects** inspired by what I’ve learned.  

This repo is my personal record of growth — not just following courses, but **turning lessons into my own work and portfolio pieces**.
