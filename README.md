# 📚 Learning Log

Public record of my Python & AI journey — what I’m learning, practicing, and building.  
I’m strengthening core **software engineering** skills while expanding into **Python + AI** for hybrid roles.

> ⚡ Career Note: I’m actively pursuing **Full-Stack/Web Dev (PERN)** roles while building Python & AI competency in parallel.

## 🤖 AI Learning Roadmap
**Section 1 – Chatbot Learning**  
Following *“Chatbot — The Development Guide 2025”* (Eric Roby). For each tutorial, I ship a **spin-off** version to apply concepts (target: **80% coding / 20% reading**).  
Repo: [`chatbot-learning`](https://github.com/patckennedy/chatbot-learning)

**Upcoming Sections**
- Data & ML Foundations
- AI Apps & Deployment
- Agents (Core + OpenAI Focus)
- Agents (Advanced Orchestration)
- Scaling AI Engineering
- Advanced Web + AI Integration
- Portfolio Development
- Capstone & Career Prep

## 📂 Mini-Projects by Month
- **[Month 1 – Python Fundamentals](month-01_python-llm-basics/README.md)**  
*(Each month folder includes mini-projects, notes, and a sub-README.)*

---

## ✅ Current Status
- **Path**: IT Support → Full-Stack (PERN) → AI Engineer in Training  
- **Now Learning**: M1 – Python Foundations & Intro to LLMs  
- **Job Focus**: Applying for **Web Dev roles** while building AI skills

**Study Tracks**
1) *Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python* – fundamentals + exercises  
2) *Chatbot — The Development Guide 2025* – hands-on chatbot builds  
3) *LLM Engineering: Master AI, Large Language Models & Agents* – transformers, APIs, agents

Practice loop:
- Take short notes in Weekly Logs
- Rebuild/extend projects in a fresh environment
- Create extra mini-projects from each lesson
