# 🐍 Python Notes Hub

This is my **central reference hub** for all Python concepts I’m learning as part of my AI Engineer journey.  
Each major concept has its own page, linked below.

## 📑 Table of Contents
1. [Variables & Data Types](./variables.md)  
2. [Functions](./functions.md)  
3. (Add more links here as new `.md` files are created)

## 🔹 How to Use This
- This file = **hub** (like a table of contents + roadmap).  
- Linked files (e.g., `variables.md`, `functions.md`) = **detailed notes** with explanations, code, errors, and examples.  
- As I learn more, I’ll add new topics here and link them to new `.md` files.

⭐ Notes are for **personal study + professional reference**.  
They may start simple but will grow as I revisit topics and polish them.
