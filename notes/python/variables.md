# 📝 Variables & Data Types

## 📖 Concept
Variables are **containers for storing data** in Python.  
They can hold numbers, text, lists, or even more complex objects.  
Python automatically assigns the type based on the value you give it.

## 💡 Why It Matters
- **Foundation of all programming** — everything in Python is stored in variables.  
- Essential for **AI/ML** → models, datasets, and configs are all stored in variables.  
- Helps write **readable, reusable code** instead of repeating values.

## 🖥️ Code Examples
```python
# Assigning variables
age = 25
name = "Patricia"
is_student = True
height = 5.6

# Printing values
print(age)        # 25
print(name)       # Patricia
print(is_student) # True
print(height)     # 5.6

# Updating variables
age = age + 1
print(age)        # 26

```
