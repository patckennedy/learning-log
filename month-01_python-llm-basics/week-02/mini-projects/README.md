# 🛠️ Week 2 – Mini Projects

## 📝 Planned Mini-Projects
- **To-Do List CLI** → Add, view, and remove tasks (stored in a file).

## 💡 Notes
- Each project will include its own `README.md` describing purpose, usage, and lessons learned.  
- I am keeping the project small and focused — the goal is **practice and learning**, not production-level apps.
