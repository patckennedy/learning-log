# 🛠️ Week 2 – Mini Projects

This folder contains **small CLI projects** built during Week 2.  
Each project applies Python concepts from this week: collections, file handling, and CLI basics.  

---

## 📂 Project Structure
Each mini-project will live in its own subfolder:  


---

## 📝 Planned Mini-Projects
- **File Reader CLI** → Read a text file and display its contents.  
- **To-Do List CLI** → Add, view, and remove tasks (stored in a file).  
- **Word Counter** → Count words in a text file using collections.  

---

## 💡 Notes
- Each project will include its own `README.md` describing purpose, usage, and lessons learned.  
- Keep projects small and focused — the goal is **practice and learning**, not production-level apps.
