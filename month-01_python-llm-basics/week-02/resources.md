## 💡 Key Takeaways
- **Lists** → ordered, changeable, allow duplicates.  
- **Tuples** → ordered, **immutable**.  
- **Sets** → unordered, unique items only.  
- **Dictionaries** → key–value pairs, fast lookups.  
- Always use `with open(filename, mode) as f:` for safe file handling.  
- Use `try/except` when working with file paths to prevent crashes.
