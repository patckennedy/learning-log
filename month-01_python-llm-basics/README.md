## 📅 Roadmap (Month 1 – Python & LLM Basics Only)  

### 🎯 Focus
- Build solid Python foundations  
- Write first small AI apps  

### 📚 Topics & Resources
- **Python Fundamentals** → Udemy Bootcamp + Kaggle  
- **File Handling & CLI Apps** → Practice through mini-projects (separate tutoring thread if needed)  
- **Intro to LLMs** → Kaggle tutorials + OpenAI docs  
- **First API Call to LLM** → OpenAI Quickstart / Hugging Face Inference API  

### ✅ Exit Criteria
By the end of Month 1, I will have:  
1. **One CLI App** (e.g., To-Do List, Notes, or Expense Tracker)  
2. **One Python Script** that calls an LLM and saves the result to a file  

Both apps will be **pushed to GitHub** with a proper `README.md`.
