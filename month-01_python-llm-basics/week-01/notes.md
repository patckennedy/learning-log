# Week 1: Aug 18–22, 2025 – Summary

## What I practiced

-   Python setup in PyCharm  
-   Object & Data Structure basics (numbers, variables, string properties & methods)
-   Print formatting with strings


## Key takeaways

-   Python is flexible with variable types (no need to declare data type). 
-   Strings have built-in methods (like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.replace()`) that save time.
-   f-strings (f"{var}") are more readable and flexible than other formatting methods.
-   Setting up a proper IDE (PyCharm) early saves debugging time later.

## Sticking points

-   Remembering when to use single vs double quotes in strings.
-   Confusion around .format() placeholders compared to f-strings.
-   Needed a refresher on Python naming conventions (snake_case for variables).

## Next week goals

-   Cover Python collections: lists, dictionaries, tuples, booleans, comparison operators, and statements.  
-   Start the Kaggle *Intro to Machine Learning* course.  
-   Practice solving at least 5 beginner coding challenges (strings + lists). 


## Reflection
Week 1 was mostly about setting up tools (PyCharm, GitHub workflow) and refreshing Python basics.  
I realized that even a small project like the Name & Age app can show progress.  
Next week, I want to be more consistent with practice and commit earlier in the week.
