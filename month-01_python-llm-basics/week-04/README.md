# 📘 Week 4 – Python Review & Project Building

This week is about slowing down, reviewing what I’ve learned so far, and proving it through **projects**.  
I’m leaning on my Udemy Bootcamp to practice data types and conditionals while creating small but useful apps.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
By the end of this week I want to:  
- Show that I can **use Python data structures and conditionals** in real code.  
- Have **3–5 beginner projects** pushed to GitHub with READMEs.  
- Strengthen my foundation before moving into heavier LLM work.

⭐ This week is more about **hands-on coding** than learning new theory. Every project, no matter how small, gets its own folder, `main.py`, and README.
